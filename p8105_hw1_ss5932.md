The following is my solution to Homework 1.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Question 1

*Creating a data frame with the specified elements:*

``` r
prob1_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10), 
  samp_gt_0 = samp > 0, 
  char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "high", "high", "high"))
  )
```

*Finding the mean of each variable in the data frame:*

``` r
  mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
## [1] 0.5470158
  mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
## [1] 0.7
  mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
## [1] NA
  mean(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
## [1] NA
```

I was able to successfully take the mean of variables that are logical
and numeric (samp and samp\_gt\_0), but not of the character and factor
vector variables (char\_vec and factor\_vec).

*Converting the vectors to numeric type:*

``` r
  as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp)) 
  as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
  as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
  as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

I could successfully convert the logical and factor variables to
numeric, however I could not convert the character variable to a numeric
type. The logical variables of samp and samp\_gt\_0 can be converted to
numeric because they’re logical and numeric. The factor variable has
levels so a numeric value can be assigned in order of the level.
However, the character variable does not have any levels or logic so R
cannot coerce the variable and a numeric value cannot be assigned to the
vector.

The result of this conversion helps to explain why earlier, the mean
could be calculated for logical and numeric vectors but not for the
character vector.

*Converting the vectors to another type:*

``` r
  as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
##  [1] 0.8109912 0.2650356 1.3753443 0.0000000 1.6793098 1.0242796 0.6388791
##  [8] 1.7462415 0.0000000 0.0000000
  as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
  as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
##  [1]  1.6219824  0.5300711  2.7506887 -1.3308750  3.3586195  2.0485593
##  [7]  1.2777581  3.4924830 -0.2767882 -0.4622602
```

The result of the conversion of the logical vector to a factor then
multiplied by the random sample is not meaningful because when the
variable becomes a factor vector, arithmetic functions are not
applicable.

# Question 2

*Description of penguins dataset:*

``` r
  summary(penguins)
  view(penguins)
```

The sample size of the dataset is 344 penguins. The dataset has 344 rows
and 8 columns.

The penguins dataset collected information on 8 variables, and those
variables are species, island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm,
flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year. The three species of
penguins in the dataset are Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo, and they live on
the islands of Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen.

The bill length ranges from 32.1 mm to 59.6 mm. The bill depth ranges
from 13.1 mm to 21.5 mm. The flipper length ranges from 172 mm to 231
mm. The average body mass of penguins is 4201.754386 g. The number of
female penguins vs. male penguins in the dataset is as follows: 165,
168.

The mean flipper length of the penguins in the dataset is 200.9152047
mm.
